         <strong>Period Cramps (Dysmenorrhea)</strong><br>
           Period cramps are caused by the muscles in the uterus contracting during menstruation. This is usually triggered by  prostaglandins, hormone-like substances that cause inflammation and pain. Higher prostaglandin levels lead to stronger contractions and more severe cramps.<br><br>
           <img class="fitted" src="https://www.astraveinvascular.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/10/effective-self-care-for-severe-menstrual-cramps.jpg" alt="Exercise Video" width="300" /> <br>
          <strong>Types of Cramps:</strong><br>
          - Primary dysmenorrhea: Common type, starting shortly after menstruation begins. Primarily caused by prostaglandins.<br>
          - Secondary dysmenorrhea: Caused by underlying medical conditions like endometriosis, fibroids, or pelvic inflammatory disease.    <br><br>
          <strong>Possible Causes of Severe Cramps:</strong><br>
          - Endometriosis: Tissue similar to the uterine lining grows outside the uterus.<br>
          - Uterine fibroids: Noncancerous growths in the uterine wall.<br>
          - Adenomyosis: Tissue that lines the uterus grows into the uterine muscular walls.<br>
          - Pelvic inflammatory disease (PID): Infection of the female reproductive organs.<br>
          - Cervical stenosis: Narrowed cervical opening increases uterine pressure.<br>
          - Intrauterine device (IUD): May cause pain, especially initially.<br>
          - Ovarian cysts: Can cause severe cramping.<br><br>
          <strong>When to See a Doctor:</strong><br>
          Consult a doctor if you experience:
          - Increased need for painkillers<br>
          - Pain before your period begins<br>
          - Persistent pain after bleeding stops<br><br>
          <strong>Treatment:</strong><br>
          - Over-the-counter pain relievers: NSAIDs (ibuprofen, naproxen), acetaminophen (Tylenol).<br>
          - Hormonal birth control: Reduces prostaglandin production.<br>
          - Prescribed pain relievers: In some cases, stronger medications may be necessary.<br>
          - Lifestyle changes: Warm compresses, relaxation techniques, exercise.<br><br>
